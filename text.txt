In step 4, we will keep track of the player's lives in the Hangman game. We will create a variable to count the lives, reduce the count when a wrong guess is made, end the game when lives run out, and show the hangman picture based on the remaining lives.

Explanation Points
Create the lives Variable:

Make a new variable called lives.
Set lives to 6.
Check if Guess is Incorrect:

Use an if statement to check if the guessed letter is not in the chosen word.
If the guess is wrong, subtract 1 from lives.
End Game When Lives are Zero:

After subtracting lives, check if lives is zero.
If lives is zero, end the game and print "You lose."
Display Hangman Stages:

Show the hangman picture that matches the current number of lives.
Avoid Placing the Condition Inside the Loop:

Put the check for wrong guesses outside the for loop to avoid subtracting lives multiple times for one wrong guess.
Use of Print Statements for Debugging:

Use print statements to see the current game state and help find and fix any problems in the code.
These points will help you understand and implement the steps to manage lives and update the hangman display in the game.
