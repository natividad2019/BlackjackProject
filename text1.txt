Summary of the Hangman Game
Hangman is a game where you try to guess a hidden word. The word is shown as a series of blanks. You guess one letter at a time. If the letter is in the word, it fills in the blanks. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life. You win if you guess the word before you run out of lives. You lose if you run out of lives before guessing the word.









step 5 : Hangman game where a player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word. The player wins by guessing all letters correctly or loses if they run out of lives.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Imports and Setup:

Import necessary modules and lists:
random for random selection.
word_list from another file (hangman_words.py).
logo and stages from another file (hangman_art.py).
Choose a Random Word:

Pick a random word from the word_list.
Find out how many letters are in this word.
Initialize Game Settings:

Set end_of_game to False (the game continues).
Set lives to 6 (number of wrong guesses allowed).
Display the Game Logo:

Print the logo to start the game.
Testing Code:

Print the chosen word (just for testing purposes, not part of the actual game).
Create Blanks:

Create a list of underscores (_), one for each letter in the chosen word.
Game Loop:

Keep asking the player to guess a letter until the game ends (end_of_game becomes True).
Handle Player's Guess:

Ask the player to guess a letter and convert it to lowercase.
Check for Repeated Guess:

If the player guesses a letter they already guessed, inform them.
Check the Guessed Letter:

Compare the guessed letter to each letter in the chosen word.
If it matches, replace the corresponding underscore with the letter.
Wrong Guess Handling:

If the guessed letter is not
in the chosen word, inform the player and subtract one life.
- If the player has no lives left, end the game and print "You lose."

Update Display:

Join the list of letters (and underscores) into a string and print it to show the current state of the word.
Check for Win:

If there are no more underscores in the display, the player has guessed all letters correctly, end the game, and print "You win."
